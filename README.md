Ludum Dare 26
=============

Code repository for the 26th installment of the Ludum Dare competition, with 'Minimalism' as its theme.

The game is developed in Haxe, using the NME and HaxePunk libraries. Graphics are created using Pixen.

In this game, you are trapped in a building, with only a torch to keep yourself company. However, the complex give shelter to creatures sensitive to light. Try to find the exit without disturbing them. If you stumble upon one, douse the torch and hide before it gets you!
